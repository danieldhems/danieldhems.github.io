    <div class="intro">
      <p>Focusing on the front end, writing clean, semantic markup and well-structured styles. Giving too much thought to naming-convention, and finding joy in geeky things that make development easier. Overly-specific CSS selectors make me sad.</p>

      <p>Excited by JS app frameworks and advanced workflow tools. Generating documentation from commented code gives me the warm-and-fuzzies. Using the terminal and bash every chance I get.</p>

      <p>It's hard to imagine building without Git.</p>

          <h3 class="project-title"><a href="pong">Pong (playable)</a></h3>
          <img class="project-image" src="images/960/pong.jpg" alt="">
          <p>This is my own rendition of the classic game, built with JS and the DOM. I wanted to try something new and challenging, and found inspiration from some live-coding talks I watched online, so I decided to give this a shot. The game uses JS only (no frameworks or libraries) for ball and paddle movement, and collision detection.</p>
          <p>It's more a proof-of-concept than a finished product, but something I continue to be proud of.</p>
          <p>I am looking to expand on this in the near future and build something more complicated with canvas.</p>

          <p>This project saw my first outing with the MEAN stack (Mongo DB, Angular, Express and Node), and has been a great learning experience for me in using these exciting new tools. I tackled many new challenges in building this site, many of which opened doors to new techniques and practises that I now use as standard.</p>
